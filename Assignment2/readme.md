# COMP248 Java Assignment 2

This folder contains two Java programs are designed to compute the latency incurred during data transfer over a network.

## Programs

### 1. Static Latency-Computer Program (Q1)

**Description:**
A basic program for computing the Latency (in milliseconds) incurred during the transfer of a given quantity of data, from a source (IP address) node to a destination (IP address) node, over a predefined (via bandwidth) communication channel/link within the Project-S Metropolitan Area Network (MAN).

**Usage:**
1. Prompts the user to enter the bandwidth in {n}{x}bps format.
2. Prompts the user to enter the source IP address.
3. Prompts the user to enter the destination IP address.
4. Prompts the user to enter the data amount in {n}{y}B format.
5. Computes and displays the latency.

### 2. Dynamic Latency-Computer Program (Q2)

**Description:**
A basic program for computing the Latency (in milliseconds) incurred during the transfer of a predefined quantity of data, between any two (2) nodes, either via a given bandwidth channel/link or latency specification within the Project-S Metropolitan Area Network (MAN).

**Usage:**
1. Prompts the user to enter a weekday, mode, and data quantity.
2. Computes and displays the latency based on the entered values.

## IDE

- **IntelliJ IDEA Version:** 2022.3.1

## How to Run

1. Open the desired program (Q1.java or Q2.java) in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Run the `main` method in the selected program.
3. Follow the prompts to enter the required information.
4. The program will display the computed latency based on the input values.
