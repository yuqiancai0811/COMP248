//Assignment 1 Question 2
//Written by: Yuqian Cai

//general explanation: This program are including two parts. One is like a search system to help customers know how much balance left in their gift card account
//						and how many tickets they can buy by entering their gift card retailer name and their gift card amount. Another is for customers input
//						how many tickets want to buy and then give them an output information like an invoice including the number of tickets, how much redeemed
//						from gift card, the balance left, purchased date,etc.
